# Java
Here I will write Notes on Java and Codes of Java

#### Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language.
Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystem in the year 1995.

Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

#### Types of Java Applications

1) Standalone Application  
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc.

2) Web Application  
An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application.

3) Enterprise Application  
An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering.

4) Mobile Application  
An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
A generel purpose programming language moade for developers to write one run anywhere i.e, compiled jave code can run on all platform.

#### History of Java
 Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995.  
 Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.

#### Features of Java  
A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.  
1.Simple - Java syntax is based on C++. Java has removed explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.

2.Object-Oriented - Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.  
Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.  
Basic concepts of OOPs are:  
1.Object
2.Class
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Encapsulation

3.Portable - Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.

4.Platform independent - Java is a write once, run anywhere language.  
There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.
1.Runtime Environment
2.API(Application Programming Interface)

5.Secured - Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
No explicit pointer  
Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox  
Classloader  
Bytecode Verifier  
Security Manager

6.Robust
7.Architecture neutral
8.Interpreted
9.High Performance
10.Multithreaded
11.Distributed
12.Dynamic

#### Data Types in Java
- Primitive Data Types - Boolean, Byte, char, short, int, long, float, double.
- Non-primitive Data Types - Array, Class.
